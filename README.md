# Stock Price Change Alert System (Basic Implementation)

This simple web application built using React with a Flask backend allows users to set stock price alerts for specific stocks, and it will notify them if the stock price crosses a defined threshold.


## Tools:

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Flask
- **WebSocket**: Socket.IO for real-time notifications
- **Stock Price API**: Yahoo Finance via `yahoo_fin` Python package

## Setup:

1. Clone the repository
2. Backend dependencies: Install the requirements using "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the terminal (in the main project directory)
3. Run the backend with python app.py
4. Frontend dependencies: Install the requirements running "npm install" in the stock-alert-frontend sub-folder
5. Start the web application using "npm start"
